# C to Promela Converter

This project is a **C to Promela code converter** built using **Flex** and **Bison**. It parses a subset of the C programming language and translates it into **Promela**, the modeling language used by the **SPIN** model checker. The tool is designed to facilitate the verification of C programs using model checking techniques.

## 🛠️ Features

- Parses key C constructs including:
  - Variable declarations
  - Control flow statements (`if`, `for`, `while`, `do-while`, `switch`)
  - Functions and return types
  - `break`, `continue`, and other common statements
- Translates these constructs into equivalent Promela syntax
- Easy to compile and extend
